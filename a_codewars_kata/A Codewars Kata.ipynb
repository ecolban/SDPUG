    "At codewars.com, you can practice your coding skills by solving small coding challenges called kata. After solving a kata, you can see the solutions of others who have solved the kata. Often you discover that there is a better and simpler solution to the problem, an by letting yourself be inspired by others you can improve your coding skills. Since solutions are accepted in many different languages, it's also a great way to learn new languages. "

    "This talk is about a kata that I enjoyed in particular. It's about generating the cards of the game \"Spot It!\" (also known a \"Dobbel\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Spot It!\" is played with a deck of 55 cards. Each cards has eight figures and any pair of cards is such that the two cards have exactly one figure in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/spotitcards-1024x851.jpg\" alt=\"spotit\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is: How do you make a deck of cards? How do you distribute the figures (there are 57 in total) onto the cards in such a way that, given any two cards, they have exactly one figure in common?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, this looks like a typical discrete optimization problem: Create one card at the time, making sure that it has one figure in common with each of the cards that has already been made. If stuck, backtrack, until all 55 cards have been made. If that takes too long, try to come up with something clever!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a hint is provided: Think of a card as a point on a plane and the figures on the card as the lines that pass through that point. From geometry, we know that through any pair of distinct points, passes one and only one line. This translates to the cards as: Given any two cards, they have one and only one figure in common.\n",

    "First step in defining a finite geometry is to define a finite field, a.k.a. Galois field. For this problem will need the set of non-negative integers less than $p$, where $p$ is a prime. Let's call this set $GF(p)$. This set can be represented in python as `range(p)`. Addition is defined as addition modulo 7, i.e., the sum of two numbers $m$ and $n$ is $(m + n) \\mod p$. Likewise for multiplication; the product of $m$ and $n$ is $m \\cdot n \\mod p$. For every number $m \\in GF(p)$, there exists a number $n\\in GF(p)$ such that $m + n \\equiv 0 \\mod p$, and for every number $m \\in GF(p)$ other than zero, there exists a number $n\\in GF(p)$ (the multiplicative inverse of $m$) such that $m \\cdot n \\equiv 1 \\mod p$. For example, if $p = 7$, then 2 and 4 are inverse because $2 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$. Likewise, 3 and 5 are inverse, 1 is its own inverse and so is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way as we can define the Euclidean plane as the Cartesian product of $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$, we can define a finite plane as $GF(p)\\times GF(p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is an illustration of $GF(7) \\times GF(7)$. Each dot represents a point. The point $(0, 0)$ is the bottom-left point. The seven highlighted dots represent a line. An equation for this line is $4x + y + 2 = 0$. It is easy to verify that the highlighted points satisfy this equation. For example, the point $(2, 4)$ satisfies the equation because $4\\cdot 2 + 4 + 2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every line has an equation of the form $ax + by + c = 0$, but the equation is not unique. The reason is that we can multiply all the coefficients by a same number and we get another equation for the same line. For example, the equations $x + 2y + 4 = 0$, $2x + 4y + 1= 0$, $3x + 6y + 5 = 0$, and $4x + y + 2 = 0$ are all equations of the same line. To guarantee a unique representation of each line by an equation $ax + by + c = 0$, we impose that $a = 1$ or $a = 0$, and, if $a = 0$, then $b = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure shows that we can connect the points by continuous lines that wrap around the square (i.e., when a line reaches an edge, it continues at the opposite edge in the same direction). The slope of the yellow line is 3, which suggests that the seven points have slope 3. However, the magenta line has slope $-1/2$, which suggests that the seven points have slope $-1/2$. But in $GF(7)$, $-1/2 = -4 = 3$, so in $GF(7)$, the magenta line has slope 3 too. The cyan line has slope $2/3 = 2 \\cdot 1/3 = 2\\cdot 5 = 3$ in $GF(7)$. Again we get that the slope is 3. No matter how one connects the points, the slope is always represented by the number 3 in $GF(7)$."
