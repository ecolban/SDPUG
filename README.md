# Presentations given to San Diego Python User Group

Over the past years, I have given several short "lightning talks" to the Python user group in San Diego. I've used different media for my presentation; slides, notebooks, code.

In this project, I am collecting all my presentations into one place. Each presentation will have a notebook and, if needed, some code. There are no more slides. In the notebooks, I try to capture what I said during the presentations, and sometimes adding more details (what I wished to say, but had not sufficient time to say it).
